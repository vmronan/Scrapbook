- added tab bar icons, made the highlighted color appropriate for the social media site
- made look cleaner by keeping the background for the whole app white
- color-coordinated other parts of the searching screen (pink/blue text, pink/blue spinner)

- I used to store the URL of the photos in the database, now I save each photo locally in the Documents directory of the app and store the path in the database
- download images asynchronously, doesn't freeze UI at all anymore
